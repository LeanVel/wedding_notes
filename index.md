## 1. Introduction

Welcome to our wedding! Weâ€™re so excited to have you join us on Saturday, March 22, 2025. The ceremony will kick off in the late afternoon and, following Argentine tradition, will carry on into the early hours of the morning. The big day will take place in Viedma, the brideâ€™s hometown, nestled in the beautiful region of Patagonia, Argentina.

Viedma is a peaceful city by the Rio Negro and the capital of RÃ­o Negro Province. It has a rich history and some lovely scenery, which should make for a great backdrop to our wedding.

We canâ€™t wait to share not just our love but also a bit of Patagonia with you. We hope you enjoy the celebration and get a chance to explore Viedma and the surrounding area.

**Plan:**

- **Friday, March 21st:** Weâ€™re kicking things off with some pre-wedding drinks on Friday night. Itâ€™ll be a relaxed get-together at a local bar, perfect for meeting everyone and starting the weekend off right.

- **Saturday, March 22nd:** The wedding ceremony will start around 17:00 and will go on late into the night, just like we do in Argentina.

For the night of the wedding, weâ€™ve got transportation covered to and from your hotel or apartment, so you wonâ€™t have to worry about driving.

- **Sunday, March 23rd:** Depending on how much energy we have left after the party, weâ€™ll be around for a classic merienda with "mates" and "facturas" by the river. Itâ€™s a laid-back way to wind down and enjoy some more time together.

## 2. Traveling from the Netherlands to Viedma

Traveling from the Netherlands to Viedma, Argentina, involves several steps, as there are no direct flights between the two locations. Viedma is a quaint small town with limited facilities, so please take that into account when planning your trip. Itâ€™s best to have a rental car to move around the city and visit nearby landmarks. However, since the town is relatively small, itâ€™s also possible to get around on foot. If you plan to rent a car, itâ€™s advisable to do so in Bahia Blanca, the nearest larger city, where you can find agencies like Avis, Hertz, and Sixt. We recommend Bahia Blanca as a gateway to Patagonia, but keep in mind that the more exciting attractions are further south. ðŸ˜‰ Here's a guide to help you plan your journey effectively:

### Step 1: Flight from the Netherlands to Argentina
- **Major Airports in the Netherlands:** Your journey will likely start at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (AMS).
- **Destination Airport in Argentina:** The most common entry point into Argentina is Ezeiza International Airport (EZE) in Buenos Aires.
- **Airlines:** KLM, Air France, and Lufthansa are among the airlines that offer flights from Amsterdam to Buenos Aires, often with a layover in cities like Paris, Frankfurt, or Madrid.

### Step 2: From Buenos Aires to Viedma
Once you arrive in Buenos Aires, you have several options to reach Viedma:

#### Option 1: Domestic Flight
- **Airport Transfer:** Domestic flights typically depart from Aeroparque Jorge Newbery (AEP). If you're not planning to stay in Buenos Aires before heading to Viedma, you will need to transfer from Ezeiza International Airport (EZE) to Aeroparque Jorge Newbery (AEP).
- **Airlines:** AerolÃ­neas Argentinas operates flights from Buenos Aires to Gobernador Castello Airport (VDM) in Viedma. However, be aware that this flight is not very popular, and there is a risk of it being postponed or canceled altogether.

You can book these flights directly through the [AerolÃ­neas Argentinas website](https://www.aerolineas.com.ar/en-eu). The website supports English, and they also have a mobile app available.

#### Option 2: Bahia Blanca Route (Recommended)
- **Flight:** Another option is to fly from Buenos Aires (Aeroparque Jorge Newbery - AEP) to Comandante Espora Airport (BHI) in Bahia Blanca. This flight can also be booked via the [AerolÃ­neas Argentinas website](https://www.aerolineas.com.ar/en-eu).
- **Ground Travel:** From Bahia Blanca, you can either rent a car for the approximately 3-hour drive to Viedma or take a bus, which takes around 4 hours. 
- **Bus Tickets:** Tickets can be purchased online through platforms like [Plataforma 10](https://www.plataforma10.com.ar) or [Central de Pasajes](https://www.centraldepasajes.com.ar). (Only in Spanish, so it's best to use Chrome to translate the website or start with Duolingo soon ðŸ˜‰ )

**Note:** We **highly recommend** this option because there are multiple daily flights from Buenos Aires (Aeroparque Jorge Newbery - AEP) to Comandante Espora Airport (BHI). This route is more popular, flights are rarely canceled, and renting a car from Bahia Blanca provides greater mobility and flexibility, especially if you're interested in exploring the surrounding areas.

#### Option 3: Car Rental from Buenos Aires
- **Drive:** For those who prefer a road trip, you can rent a car directly from Ezeiza International Airport and drive approximately 1,000 km to Viedma. This option allows you to explore the region at your own pace.

#### Option 4: Bus Travel
- **Bus Companies:** For travel from Buenos Aires to Viedma, **Ceferino** and **Fredes** are the top choices, offering the most comfortable services, including "Cama Ejecutivo" and "Suite Premium" options with nearly 180-degree recline. These features make the 12-hour journey more relaxing. While other companies like Chevallier, VÃ­a Bariloche, and Condor Estrella also operate on this route, they do not provide the same level of comfort, making them less ideal for such a long trip.
- **Terminals:** Buses depart from Retiro Bus Station in Buenos Aires. 
- **Travel Duration:** The overnight bus from Buenos Aires to Viedma typically takes around 12 hours, departing around 20:00 and arriving at 08:00. These buses are spacious and very comfortable for sleeping.
- **Bus Tickets:** Tickets can be purchased online through platforms like [Plataforma 10](https://www.plataforma10.com.ar). (Only in Spanish, so it's best to use Chrome to translate the website or start with Duolingo soon ðŸ˜‰ )

**Note:** One disadvantage of this option is that renting a car in Viedma might not provide the same quality or variety of choices as renting in Bahia Blanca, so there's a risk of getting a mediocre vehicle or none at all.

### Travel Tips
- **Planning:** Arrive in Buenos Aires at least a day before your domestic connection to Viedma to accommodate potential delays. 
- **Luggage:** Ensure your luggage meets airline and bus company requirements to avoid any issues during transfers.
- **Currency Exchange:** Exchange some money into Argentine pesos at the airport for immediate expenses such as transportation or food.

## 3. Accommodation Options
**Comming soon**. The idea will be to share some trusted sources and tips so you can either gather with some other guest and arrange with them something bigger or book something for yourselfes.
